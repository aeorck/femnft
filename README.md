## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have always been confused about the usage of positioning a HTML block with the use of

```html
<span class="codesnip"> Position:absolute</span>
```

and

```html
<span class="codesnip"> position:relative </span>
```

, but from taking my time to learn its relativity to designing a hitch-free static website through concurrent testing, I was finally able to get the hang of it.

```css
.codesnip {
  color: papayawhip;
  width: fit-content;
  font-family: consolas;
}
```

### Continued development

My intention is to continue developing myself in the aspect of a responsive and beautiful web design, especially in the area of HTML syntax and the use of SASS/CSS to improve my design before transitioning into Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [How to use Position in CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-positioning-position-absolute-and-relative/) - This helped me in understanding the concept attached positioning in CSS, to using **relative** and **absolute** positioning. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
